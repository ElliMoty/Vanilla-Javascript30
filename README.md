## My daily projects

### Day 1: 25 Dec 2018

**lesson1:** Learned some methods in vanilla Js! - data attributes, key event, keyCodes, `transitionend` event.

**handy pages:** Nice tool for finding JavaScript event keyCodes at [keycode.info](http://keycode.info/). For passing this course you can have a look at [Palash Mondal](https://github.com/palashmon)'s page too.

**Demo:** My first project is [here](https://ellimoty.github.io/Vanilla-Javascript30/Project01-DrumKit/index.html).
